# Recognizer-Tools
Tools to normalize images and to check them on exisiting recognizing algorithms.

To implement this tools I used:
* OpenCV 2.4.11
* Boost 1.57

So, to use Recognizer-Tools you will need just to execute precompilled binaries in CMD.

To actually build project you must setup framerok and dependencies in your IDE.
